# EthAVAX1
This Solidity program is a simple ethereum token contract program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how ethereum works.
# DESCRIPTION
The OwnerManagedContract is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It introduces basic ownership management and includes functions for updating a balance, performing assertion checks, and triggering explicit transaction reversals. The contract ensures that certain functions can only be executed by the contract owner, providing a level of access control. The setBalance function allows the owner to set the contract's balance, while the assertExample function checks if the balance is greater than 0 using an assertion. Additionally, the revertFunction demonstrates how to explicitly revert a transaction with a custom error message when a specified condition is met, in this case, when the input value is zero.
# GETTING STARTED
## Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., BATSHEBA.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once you have successfully compiled and deployed your MyToken contract to the Ethereum blockchain, you can start using it for various purposes, such as creating and managing your own cryptocurrency. 

Before you can interact with the contract, you need to deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain. 

After deployment, you can interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or other smart contract interaction tools.
